## 📋 **What Happens After Deploy**

### **You Get a URL Like:**

- ✅ Shows your **website worldwide**
- ✅ Connected to **MongoDB Atlas** (your cloud database)
- ✅ Your **admin panel works**
- ✅ Staff can add items from anywhere

### **Later, Add Your Domain**
When you buy a domain (e.g., `brew4you.com`):
